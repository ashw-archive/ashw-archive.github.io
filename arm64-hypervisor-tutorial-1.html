  <p>Hello and welcome to my new tutorial series on writing a bare metal hypervisor for 64-bit Arm systems!</p><p>In
 this series we will cover the fundamentals of virtualization in
 the 64-bit Arm architecture and develop an accompanying
hypervisor step-by-step, beginning with simple examples hosting
 trivial virtual machines and working up to hosting fully-fledged
operating system kernels such as Linux. Topics discussed will
include device tree spoofing &amp; stage 2 address translations,
CPU feature spoofing &amp; instruction emulation, device
emulation, virtual interrupts, firmware interactions, and more.</p><p>The hypervisor code is being actively developed as an<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ashwio/arm64-hypervisor-tutorial"> open source project on GitHub</a> and will be demoed throughout the series on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/fixed-virtual-platforms">Armv8-A Foundation Platform model</a> as shipped with the freely available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/ds-5-development-studio/editions/community-edition">DS-5 Community Edition</a>. Supplementary videos will also be hosted on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjQh0UZyN0dMdRY-11SPnIw">my new YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>This
 first post aims to introduce some key concepts and then kick-starts
development with an example of how to boot a 64-bit Arm processor
into a hypervisor and print “Hello, world!” over a PL011 UART
serial console, all in A64 assembly.</p><h2>What is a hypervisor?</h2><p>First, take a step back and consider that the role of an operating system kernel is to:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>provide layers of abstraction on top of the underlying hardware;</p></li><li><p>allocate
 and schedule resources between multiple user-space
applications, including execution time, memory, file I/O, and
access to peripherals;</p></li></ul><p>In this way the kernel is said to supervise<em> </em>the
 user-space applications running on top of it. A hypervisor does
exactly the same thing, but instead of hosting multiple user-space
applications it hosts multiple operating system kernels; it
supervises the supervisor, hence the name <em>hypervisor</em>.</p><p>A
 hypervisor creates virtual machines that behave as though they
are real, physical machines; in certain use cases the operating
system kernel controlling the virtual machine, referred to as a <em>guest</em>,
 truly believes it has control of a real, physical machine and has
no idea it is being virtualized. However this typically comes
with a performance penalty so in other use cases the guest is made
aware that it is being virtualized and can then cooperate with
the hypervisor to reduce overhead; this is known as
para-virtualization.</p><p>Typical applications of
virtualization include sandboxing certain processes &amp; tasks
or running a second operating system on a machine that is
already running some other operating system, such as to test
cross-platform software or to run a legacy application.
Virtualization is a widely used tool and is the cornerstone of
compute hosting services where one rents a virtual machine running
 in the cloud (think: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a>, to name but a few).</p><p>The industry defines two types of hypervisor, imaginatively named <em>Type 1</em> and <em>Type 2.</em></p><p>Type 1 hypervisors are also known as <em>bare metal</em>
 hypervisors as they sit directly on the hardware with no
underlying host operating system. In contrast, Type 2
hypervisors are also known as <em>hosted</em> hypervisors as they
either run on top of, or are themselves a part of, a host operating
 system running on the hardware:</p>
 <img src="images/type1_type2.png" alt="type1_type2" />
 <p>A well-known open source Type 1 hypervisor is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.xenproject.org/">Xen Project</a>, and for Type 2 hypervisors take a look at Linux’s built-in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)</a> solution. In this tutorial series we will be developing a Type 1 i.e. bare metal hypervisor.</p><h2>What exactly is a virtual machine?</h2><p>To
 better understand this we should first take another look at
operating system kernels, specifically the techniques they use to
 supervise user-space applications. with one of the best examples
 being virtual addressing.</p><p>Each time an application
accesses a memory location, that access is made to a virtual
address that is automatically translated to a physical address
by the memory management unit (MMU) using page tables programmed
by the kernel; these tables are also used to specify properties and
 attributes such as access permissions and whether the processor
can execute from the region.</p><p>The kernel can use the page
tables to present a fake view of the system to user-space
applications, such as by making each application believe it
running at the bottom of memory and making non-contiguous blocks
of physical memory appear as a single contiguous block to an
application.</p><p>For example, if a system has 2GB DRAM starting at address 0x8000_0000 (something you may see often on Arm systems; see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0001c/DEN0001C_principles_of_arm_memory_maps.pdf">this white paper [PDF]</a>), then an application with a 64KB working set may have a view of memory that looks something like this:</p>
<img src="images/s1mem.png" alt="s1mem" />
<p>Note how the application has no idea where in physical
memory it has actually been loaded, nor how much physical memory
is actually available, nor that its <em>malloc</em>’d buffer is
actually built up of non-contiguous blocks of physical memory;
this is simply the view that is presented to the application, and
it’s the kernel that has a view of the real, physical system.</p><p>At least, it <em>thinks</em> it does.</p><p>Enter
 the hypervisor, which controls a second set of page tables in the
 MMU, taking what the kernel thinks are physical addresses and
translating them into real, physical addresses; the hypervisor
can therefore present guest kernels with a view of the system that
may not match the actual underlying hardware.</p><p>Expanding the figure above, the kernel <em>believes</em>
 the system has 2GB DRAM starting at physical address 0x8000_0000,
but there could actually be 16GB available starting at physical
address<em> </em>0x10_0000_0000, and the 2GB visible to the kernel
is simply a buffer that the hypervisor has allocated out of that
16GB. Further, the kernel’s contiguous 2GB chunk of DRAM may
actually comprise a number of non-contiguous blocks in the real,
physical system’s memory, just like the application’s <em>malloc</em>’d buffer was in the kernel’s view of memory.</p>
<img src="images/s2mem.png" alt="s2mem" />
<p>Architecturally, the kernel controls <em>stage 1</em> translations mapping virtual addresses onto an <em>intermediate</em> physical address space, and the hypervisor controls <em>stage 2</em> translations mapping these intermediate physical addresses onto the real, physical address space.</p><p>There
 are other tools available to the hypervisor, including trapping
instructions and system register accesses, having visibility
of physical interrupts before the guest (termed <em>routing</em>),
 injecting virtual interrupts into the guest, and more. These are
used in conjunction with stage 2 translations to construct a <em>virtual</em> machine that a guest operating system kernel controls as though it is a real, physical machine. </p><p>Further,
 just like how an operating system kernel is able to context
switch between multiple user-space applications, a hypervisor
is able to context switch between multiple operating system
kernels. Technically, the hypervisor schedules <em>virtual cores</em>
 on real, physical cores, and a single virtual machine may
comprise many virtual cores; this also means we are able to run SMP
operating systems on virtual machines.</p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>The 64-bit Arm architecture defines the following levels of privilege:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>EL0 for user-space applications;</p></li><li><p>EL1 for operating system kernels;</p></li><li><p>EL2 for the hypervisor;</p></li><li><p>EL3 for firmware, which also acts as gatekeeper to the <em>Secure</em> world (TrustZone);</p></li></ul><p>Note: <em>EL</em> is short for <em>Exception Level</em>.</p><p>While
 this tutorial series primarily focuses on the interactions
between EL1 and EL2, note that an Arm processor will always reset
into the highest implemented exception level i.e. EL3 on the
Armv8-A Foundation Model. This is important because the
architecture only guarantees a bare minimum known safe state at
reset:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>the MMU and caches are disabled at the highest implemented exception level;</p></li><li><p>all asynchronous exceptions are masked at the highest implemented exception level;</p></li></ul><p>And
 that’s pretty much it; most other system registers have
architecturally UNKNOWN values at reset. This means we do not know:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>whether EL2’s MMU and caches are enabled or disabled;</p></li><li><p>whether EL2 is 32-bit or 64-bit;</p></li><li><p>whether EL2 and below are Secure or Non-secure;</p></li></ul><p>We
 will therefore need to configure these elements of the processor
context before actually dropping to EL2, otherwise we risk
performing an illegal exception return or immediately taking
an MMU abort when trying to fetch the first instruction at the
hypervisor entry point; given that EL2’s vector base address
register <em>VBAR_EL2 </em>also has an UNKNOWN reset value, this MMU
abort would likely throw us into a recursive exception upon trying
to fetch the first instruction of the synchronous exception
handler.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ashwio/arm64-hypervisor-tutorial/blob/part-01/source/entry3.S"><em>entry3.S </em>file</a> shows how to perform this configuration before passing control to the hypervisor in EL2:</p><pre class="pre"><span class="pre_padding">    <span>globalfunc</span> <span>entry3</span>

 at EL3. In the 64-bit Arm architecture, each entry in the vector
table is 32 instructions long and the entry that is branched to is
determined by both the type of the exception and from where the
exception was taken:</p>
<img src="images/vectors.png" alt="vectors" />
<p>Regarding
 the green and blue blocks, the architecture gives EL1, EL2, and EL3
the ability to switch between two stack pointers: <em>SP_EL0</em> and <em>SP_ELx</em> e.g. SP_EL2 for EL2. Privileged software uses this to switch between <em>thread</em> mode (SP_EL0) and <em>handler</em>
 mode (SP_ELx). Note that when privileged software is in thread mode
i.e. using SP_EL0, it’s not actually using the user-space stack;
rather, the user-space stack pointer will have been saved off as part of
 the application’s context and the register value overwritten
with the privileged software’s thread mode stack pointer.</p>

  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote">
    <span></span>What would happen if the vector table did not
differentiate between exceptions taken using SP_EL0 and
exceptions taken using SP_ELx, and privileged software then took a
 stack overflow?<span></span>
  </blockquote>
  — Exercise for the reader

<p>The yellow and pink blocks are used to determine how much
effort needs to be expended in context switching out the less
privileged software. Note in the yellow block we say “<em>one or more lower levels are 64-bit”</em>; this is strictly different to saying that we came <em>from</em> a 64-bit level.</p><p>Consider
 a 64-bit hypervisor at EL2 hosting a 64-bit guest kernel at EL1,
which is in turn hosting a 32-bit user-space application at EL0.
Let’s say we are currently running in the application code and take
 a hypervisor scheduler tick interrupt to EL2; we’ll need to
perform a full 64-bit context switch even though we came from a 32-bit
 context, so in this example we’d have taken the exception to the
yellow vector block. In contrast, if the guest kernel itself was
32-bit then we’d have taken the exception to the pink vector block.</p><p>We
 refer to the vector table installed here as a “dummy” because each
 entry is just a branch-to-self instruction; this is useful early on
 in development before we have written a proper vector table, and
 for early on in the boot process before we are actually ready to
handle exceptions. Even though we’re not going to be doing
anything in EL3, it’s good practice to install a dummy vector table
 so that any exceptions result in safely spinning and we can use a
debugger to read out the syndrome registers to figure out what
went wrong; otherwise we’d instead get thrown into a recursive
exception and the syndrome register will be trampled.</p><h2>Hello, world!</h2><p>The hypervisor entry point in EL2 is defined in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ashwio/arm64-hypervisor-tutorial/blob/part-01/source/entry2.S"><em>entry2.S</em></a>:</p>

 doesn’t do a full initialisation; this is because the UART is not
fully modelled on the Armv8-A Foundation Platform and is instead
piped in/out over a local Telnet connection, so we don’t need to
worry about setting the word length or baud rate and can instead just
clear any flags and enable the UART:</p><pre class="pre"><span class="pre_padding">    <span>/*</span>

macros ensure the stack pointer is kept 16-byte aligned even if less
than 16 bytes are being pushed onto the stack; this is a requirement
of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ihi0055/b">64-bit Arm Procedure Call Standard [PDF]</a>.</p><p>That same document defines register conventions such as <em>x30</em>
 being the link register, as well as which registers must be
preserved between function calls and which can be trampled over by
the callee. In the case of <em>pl011_puts()</em> we need to preserve the pointer to the next ASCII character between calls to <em>pl011_putc()</em>, so we put it in callee-saved register <em>x20</em>. However, the code that called <em>pl011_puts()</em> may itself have put something in <em>x20</em>
 that it needs preserving, hence we stack it then restore it before
returning at the end of the function. We also need to stack <em>x30</em> as our return address will be trampled by the calls to <em>pl011_putc()</em>.</p><h2>Link time</h2><p>In the hypervisor entry point function, <em>entry2</em>, we initialised the stack pointer to the address of <em>_stack_start</em>; this symbol is exported by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ashwio/arm64-hypervisor-tutorial/blob/part-01/linker.ld"><em>linker.ld</em></a> script:</p><pre class="pre"><span class="pre_padding">    <span>ENTRY</span>(<span>entry3</span>)

This is a <em>Fixed Virtual Platform</em> (FVP) that allows us to easily run and debug our hypervisor code in real-time (<em>you can even follow the instructions </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://community.arm.com/dev-platforms/w/docs/304/arm-reference-platforms-deliverables"><em>here</em></a><em>
 to fetch, build, and run a fully-integrated software stack on the
model, comprising firmware, boot loader, Linux kernel, and user-space
 filesystem. Disclaimer: I maintain these pages and the
corresponding workspace initialisation script in my role as an
Applications Engineer at Arm</em>).</p><p>We will use the Eclipse
for DS-5 Debugger to launch the model, load the hypervisor, then
step through the code. First launch Arm DS-5 Community Edition, then
switch to the <em>DS-5 Debug</em> perspective:</p>
<img src="images/debug.png" alt="debug" /><p>Navigate to <em>Run &gt; Debug Configurations…</em> then select <em>DS-5 Debugger</em> and click <em>New launch configuration</em>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>On the <em>Connection</em> tab, select <em>ARM Model &gt; ARMv8-Ax1 Foundation Platform &gt; Bare Metal Debug  &gt; Debug ARMv8-A</em></p></li><li><p>On the <em>Files</em> tab, in <em>Application on host to download</em>, navigate to the <em>out.elf</em> generated when you built the project, and ensure <em>Load symbols</em> is ticked</p></li><li><p>On the <em>Debugger</em> tab, select <em>Debug from symbol</em> and type <em>entry3</em> into the box</p></li></ul><p>While still on the <em>Debugger</em> tab, also tick <em>Execute debugger commands</em> then paste the following into the box, replacing <em>/path/to/out.elf</em> with the same path that you entered on the <em>Files</em> tab:</p><pre class="pre"><span class="pre_padding">    <span>file</span> <span>"/path/to/out.elf"</span> <span>EL2N</span>:<span>0x0</span>

    <span>hb</span> <span>EL2N</span>:<span>entry2</span>
    <span>continue</span></span></pre><p>These
 commands let us skip over the minimal setup code in EL3 and begin
stepping through the code from the hypervisor entry point in EL2.</p><p>For reference, the screenshots below show the debug configuration that I created on my own machine:</p>

<p>Before launching the model, make sure you have enabled the <em>Telnet Client</em> feature if running on Windows or have installed <em>xterm</em> if running on Linux.</p>
<img src="images/telnet.png" alt="telnet" /><p>You can now launch the model and will be paused at the hypervisor entry point in EL2:</p>
<img src="images/dbg_entry.png" alt="dbg_entry" /><p>Resuming execution will open a <em>Telnet</em> or <em>xterm</em> window and print “Hello, world!”:</p>
